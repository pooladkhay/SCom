An Incrementally-implemented Scheme Compiler

This is based on a paper, a supplementary tutorial, and a set of tests by Abdulaziz Ghuloum:

- [An Incremental Approach to Compiler Construction](./docs/11-ghuloum.pdf) (Paper)
- [Compilers: Backend to Frontend and Back to Front Again](./docs/compilers-tutorial-2006-09-16.pdf) (Tutorial)
- [Tests](./tests/)

I have downloaded the materials from the [Internet Archive](https://web.archive.org/web/20110310092701/http://www.cs.indiana.edu/~aghuloum/).
